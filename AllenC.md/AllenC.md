I chose the For loop example: For Loop. This program calculates the factorial of 100 and prints it out in the console. A method called factorial is created. This method uses a for loop, starts at result 1 - but index 2 in loop- and calculates the variable result + i - I represents the humber of time the loop increments - . It does this until it hits n - the number parameter needs to be filled into the method to run, in this case i in the main method which will equal 100 - . So it will add 1+2+3+4+5+6...etc.....100 - and print the result to screen.
